**How InboxWP helps to deliver your transactional emails?**

If you find it difficult to set up the default Transfer Protocol (SMTP) of WordPress, you're not alone.

Time to say goodbye to all of these.

InboxWP is here to ensure all your WordPress transactional emails are delivered reliably and timely. Such as:

1. **Password reset emails:** If users register to your website, or change passwords, they should get password reset emails in time.
1. **Sign-up emails:** When you register to a new website, you must get a sign-up confirmation email with account details.
1. **Action-based emails:** Action-based emails such as course completion, form submission, subscription, or API-based emails.
1. **eCommerce-related emails:** Such as order confirmation/cancellation, shipping notifications, order receipts, billing information, etc.
1. **More:** Event registration confirmation, Abandoned cart reminder, review request email, membership renewal reminder, account activity alert, etc. InboxWP makes sure all transactional emails from WordPress reaches the inbox of your audience every time.
